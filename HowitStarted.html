	<p> This challenge first appeared in May 2016 on various social media platforms. The point of this game is to follow tasks you do over 50 days and if you dont you will have private information released about you, and the final task of this game is death. The game was created by Philipp Budeikin, who is in jail now, he is sentenced for 22 years. He believed that the manipulation he was doing was making the players happy and he was giving them something in life they didn't have before. He also believed he was “cleaning society” by making these people kill themselves.  </p>
