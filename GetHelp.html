    	<p> The government should, and they are for example countries like, Bangladesh, Brazil, Bulgaria, China, India, Iran, Italy, Russia, and Tunisia have all put measures to prevent challenge from happening. Parents should help too The role of the parents should be to watch their kids on the internet and watch what they are getting involved with or else they can be lured into this by facebook, twitter or instagram. They can use online tools to monitor their children's activity. The parents should look for behavioural changes. If you find out someone is doing this challenge get them help and figure out a way to get them away from the game. Tell them how many people left the game and there were no recruputions upon their lives or their families life, and it's all just a hoaxs essentially. At the moment there is protection towards the youth against this. When you search up “blue whale challenge” on Google the first result is a suicide prevention website, On instagram if you search #bluewhalechallenge you are prompted a message giving you an easy way to get help. Some schools have put into their curriculum to check on their online activities including the parents on it.  So clearly there are measures put into place to prevent people from falling into this. </p>
